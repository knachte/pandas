# Pandas summary
A short list with pointers for pandas.

These are jupyter notebook files, which can be looked at on github, but it's better to clone them localy to open them with jupyter notebook so that the code in there can be run, tested and played with.

00-Content.ipynb is the index, every file has a link to the next file at the end.

This will be updated as i learn more.
